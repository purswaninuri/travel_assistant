This project requires you to harness the potential of OpenAI's API, specifically using its state-of-the-art language model, GPT-3.5 Turbo, to create an AI-powered travel guide for the culturally rich city of Paris.\n\nYour creation will become a virtual Parisian expert, delivering valuable insights into the city's iconic landmarks and hidden treasures. The AI will respond intelligently to a set of common questions, providing a more engaging and immersive travel planning experience for the clientele of Peterman Reality Tours.\n\nThe ultimate aspiration is a user-friendly, AI-driven travel guide that significantly enhances the exploration of Paris. Users will be able to pre-define their questions and receive well-informed answers from the AI, providing a seamless and intuitive travel planning process.","metadata":{},"id":"17000260-fe07-4f92-abb4-3d325226eb1f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Before you start\n\nIn order to complete the project you will need to create a developer account with OpenAI and store your API key as an environment variable.
